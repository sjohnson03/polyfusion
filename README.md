# polyfusion
A Web Application that displays 3D convex polygons and can calculate and estimate the intersection between them. This was part of a larger project that also had a 2D aspect, my part was all the 3D component. There is a backend and some user authentication and a very simple UI.

Backend functionality is not working any more as the database has been deleted.

## Tools used
JavaScript, TypeScript, Express.js, Node.js, three.js

three.js is the tool used for all the 3D functionality

# Get started
Polyfusion is available to use at https://polyfusion.onrender.com/3d


### Setup
Once the repository has been cloned we need to setup the node environment.
```shell
cd polyfusion
npm run install-all-deps
```
A local instance can now be run.
```shell
npm run dev
```  
You can then navigate to the 3D section of the application by clicking on the 3D button on the landing page.
